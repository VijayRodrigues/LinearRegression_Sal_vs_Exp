# SimpleLinearRegression_Sal_vs_Exp


## Description

This code provides Simple Linear Regression between the independent variable Experience and the dependent variable Salary.
I have considered a very small dataset with about 30 rows and 2 columns where Salary is the only feature.

The dataset is split into test data and train data set and results are compared.


## Installation

I have used Jupyter notebook and the results are plotted using a scatter plot.

The following libraries have been used:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

To apply Simple Linear Regression, scikit-learn has been referred to as follows:

```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
```

## Tools Used

Jupyter Notebook
